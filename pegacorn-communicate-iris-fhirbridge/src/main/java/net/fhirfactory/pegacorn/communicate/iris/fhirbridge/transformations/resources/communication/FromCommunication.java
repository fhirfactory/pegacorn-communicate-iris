/**
 * <h1>Transform Room Based Message to a FHIR::Communication Resource</h1>
 * <p>
 * This class is used to perform the transformation of a Room Message
 * (encapsulated as a Matrix(R) room_message_event and convert it to a
 * FHIR::Communication resource.
 * <p>
 * To do this, the code needs to construct the apropriate references (for the
 * FHIR::Communication.Identifier of the message, the
 * FHIR::Communication.Sender, the FHIR::Communication.Recipient and the
 * FHIR::Communication.Subject) - it then needs to extract the content type and
 * encapsulate it into the FHIR::Communication.payload attribute.
 * <p>
 The Reference for the FHIR::Communication.Subject and
 FHIR::Communication.Recipient are extracted from a RoomID-ReferenceMap
 maintained in the AppServers shared memory cache (see
 MatrixRoomID2ResourceReferenceMap.java).
 <p>
 * <b> Note: </b> If the content within the message is video ("m.video"), audio
 * ("m.audio") or image ("m.image") the a discrete FHIR::Media resource is
 * created and the FHIR::Communication.payload attribute is set to point (via a
 * FHIR::Reference) to the FHIR::Media element.
 *
 * <b> Note: </b> the following configuration details need to be loaded into the
 * Wildfly Application Server configuration file (standalone-ha.xml) {@code
 * <cache-container name="pegacorn-communicate" default-cache=
 * "general" module="org.wildfly.clustering.server">
 * <transport lock-timeout="15000" />
 * <replicated-cache name="general">
 * <transaction locking="OPTIMISTIC" mode="FULL_XA"/>
 * </replicated-cache>
 * <replicated-cache name="room2resource_id_map">
 * <transaction locking="OPTIMISTIC" mode="FULL_XA"/>
